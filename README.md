## Startups
* A new task management tool - confidence : 4/10
  * **Bullet point** presenting different views to manager and operationals. Today's tools either too complicated (asana), or not providing enough functionalities (Trello). Presenting different views to different people would help create a simple but powerful tool for everyone.
  * **Why it's a good idea**
    * I believe in it
  * **Why it's a bad idea**
    * Winning task management market isn't about a better product but a better growth hacking (?)
  * **Steps to go forward**
    * Make more research with product managers on wether or not it is a real pain point
    * Learn about other concurrents and what works / what doesn't

## Librairies
* Dataloader ORM - an ORM that integrates deeply with dataloader
  * The ORM would merge single calls to .find() and .update() into efficient batched find and batched updates
